			EU4 random new world is a place where you can preview and download interesting random new worlds instead of tediously generating them over and over.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The maps can be downloaded as save files. The save files were made as Castile with the initial game conditions on the initial start date. Fantasy elements were set
			to frequent. All save games are made using version 1.31.5.
			Conquest of Paradise DLC is required, I had some other DLCs turned on while doing this, because I forgot to turn them off (lol sorry). I don't know if this is game breaking, but 
			if you have the DLC subscription it should work fine. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I experimented with other ways to do this, but there was no other way to recreate a once created new world. I tried recreating new worlds using seeds, but 
			even when using one seed the world was different each time. I don't know if this is intended behaviour of the game, but generating using seed would generate a similar world,
			not one that is exactly same. If you want to use a seed:
			<ol>
				<li>Download a save file</li>
				<li>Change file extension from .eu4 to .zip</li>
				<li>Open zip and put a file called "gamestate" outside of the zip</li>
				<li>Open gamestate with a text editor (visual studio code, notepad++, etc. Regular notepad might get stuck)</li>
				<li>Press CTRL+f and search for "random_world" and copy the seed</li>
				<li>Launch a game</li>
				<li>Open console (press `)</li>
				<li>Type <i>map_random seed=<b>&lt;replace this with the number you copied&gt;</b></i> and press enter</li>
				<li>Voil√†</li>
			</ol>

			Choose on of the options below to check out the new worlds I generated.
